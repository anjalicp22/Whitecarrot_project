## AI Tools Used

### Figma

- Used Figma to generate design as inspiration for the UI layout and user flow.
- **Prompt**:
  "
  I want a career page application.

First page:

Heading: "Careers Builder"

Subheading

Dropdown to select a company, with an option to add a new company

Below the dropdown, a toggle to select between Recruiter and Candidate

Behavior:

If "New Company" is selected, only Recruiter can proceed (Candidate is not allowed). They should be redirected to an edit page to:

Set the brand theme (colors, banner, logo, culture video)

Recruiters should be able to:

Set the brand theme (colors, banner, logo, culture video)

Add, remove, or reorder content sections such as About Us, Life at Company, etc.

Preview the page before publishing

Save settings — with each company’s data stored separately

Share the company’s public Careers link

Candidates:

If an existing company is selected and the user is a Candidate, they should be redirected to the company’s Careers page where they can:

Learn about the company through the Careers page

Browse open jobs with filters (Location, Job Type) and search by Job Title

Experience a clean, mobile-friendly, and accessible UI (labels, contrast, keyboard focus)

See an SEO-ready page (crawlable HTML, meta tags, structured data)
"

- Figma's AI prompt feature helped me to visualize the application's structure.

### ChatGPT

- Used to set up the initial basic structure of the code. Since I had never used Supabase before, used ChatGPT to set up tables, account, and Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase.
- **Prompts**: General queries like "How to set up Supabase for a React app" and "Create tables for companies, jobs, etc., with RLS policies."
- ChatGPT accelerated learning Supabase basics, including schema design and RLS.

### Blackbox

- Used to solve errors, which helped me code faster and complete tasks quickly.
- **Prompts**: Examples include "Fix this TypeScript error in my CareerPage".
- **Learnings**: Blackbox's instant feedback and code generation capabilities significantly reduced debugging time, allowing me to focus on feature implementation rather than syntax or logic errors.
